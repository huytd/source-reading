* lib.rs:
This is the entry point of the library, defining all of the dependencies and exposing the library's interface to the public.

* utils.rs:
A collection of utility functions and data structures:

- fn duration_to_secs() / fn secs_to_duration(): Convert a second as an f64 number to std::time::Duration and vice versa.
- struct Estimate: 
- enum Alignment:
- struct TemplateVar:
- fn expand_template():
- fn pad_str():

Reading the test cases at the end of this file will help you make sense about what these functions/data structures are for.
